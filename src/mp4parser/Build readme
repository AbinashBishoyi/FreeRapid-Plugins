mp4parser plugin requires aspectj, therefore it has to be compiled using aspectj compiler.
The easiest way to do this is by using Eclipse IDE with aspectj plugin.
IntelliJ IDEA only supports aspectj in commercial version.
- We compile mp4parser using Eclipse. We can find the output (classes binary) in ../out/production.
- Copy com, org, and resource directory from ../out/production to ../_classes.
- Make plugin distribution (.frp) using distWithoutCompile ant task.
